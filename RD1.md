- What challenges did you encounter? 
   - How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
   - Did you overcome them, and how? 
   - Any key takeaways? 
   - Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab? 
   - What was it like working with your partner?
- I followed the first rule by making my code human-readable, I accomplished this by making my code as simple as I could and adding comments to explain my code
- A kay takeaway I got from this lab is how to do math using variables and how coding can be used to simplify everyday task, such as picking a provider.
- Doing this lab made me realize how often I use code like this as well since his kind of program is very useful in the everyday life.
- I do think I learned what I was supposed to from this lab. I learned how to store information in variables and then use those variable to do calculations
- This lab made me more confident in using more complex equations in my math so I feel now my programs can be more effective.
- Working with Leaf went well during the lab, there was not as much communication as there was with my previous labs and it was diffcult
- contacting him online but overall we did discuss in lab the project and how we should go about creating the program.
