In this assignment, we were supposed to perfect the use of both while and if-else statements. In doing so, we implemented two while statements, both of which utilized "passthru" variables to determine whether or not they would loop. We also used a variety of if-else statements to work through  the different necessary paths. Our results in the end matched what we expected and wanted, even with the fairly limited and frameworked test cases we used to determine the outcome. Along the way, we came across typecasting issues, which misread the input and crashed the program. We fixed these issues quickly after realizing that it was due to an incorrectly written variable. There are no key takeaways here that have not been reached in previous labs or programming assignments. I think that both me and my partner learned what we were supposed to regardless. Working with my partner was easy, even if it was mostly asynchronous. We understood what we needed to do and finished it up without much intervention.
